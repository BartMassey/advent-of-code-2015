While playing with all the containers in the kitchen,
another load of eggnog arrives! The shipping and receiving
department is requesting as many containers as you can
spare.

Find the minimum number of containers that can exactly fit
all 150 liters of eggnog. How many different ways can you
fill that number of containers and still hold exactly 150
litres?

In the example above, the minimum number of containers was
two. There were three ways to use that many containers, and
so the answer there would be 3.
