The elves bought too much eggnog again - 150 liters this
time. To fit it all into your refrigerator, you'll need to
move it into smaller containers. You take an inventory of
the capacities of the available containers.

For example, suppose you have containers of size 20, 15, 10,
5, and 5 liters. If you need to store 25 liters, there are
four ways to do it:

* 15 and 10
* 20 and 5 (the first 5)
* 20 and 5 (the second 5)
* 15, 5, and 5

Filling all containers entirely, how many different
combinations of containers can exactly fit all 150 liters of
eggnog?
