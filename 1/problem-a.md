Here's an easy puzzle to warm you up.

Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment
building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions
he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor
(floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at
a time.

An opening parenthesis, "`(`", means he should go up one floor,
and a closing parenthesis, "`)`", means he should go down one
floor.

The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is
very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.

For example:

* `(())` and `()()` both result in floor 0.
* `(((` and `(()(()(` both result in floor 3.
* `))(((((` also results in floor 3.
* `())` and `))(` both result in floor -1 (the first basement level).
* `)))` and `)())())` both result in floor -3.

To what floor do the instructions take Santa?
