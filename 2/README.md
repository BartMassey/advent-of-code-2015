This is mostly an exercise in careful reading and
implementing of the specification.

The Haskell feature used here is first-class functions,
which allow us to use the same solution for both
box-wrapping problems, and for any other future problems
where the total wrapping cost is the sum of the cost of
wrapping individual boxes.
