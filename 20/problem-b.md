The Elves decide they don't want to visit an infinite number
of houses. Instead, each Elf will stop after delivering
presents to 50 houses. To make up for it, they decide to
deliver presents equal to eleven times their number at each
house.

With these changes, what is the new lowest house number of
the house to get at least as many presents as the number in
your puzzle input?
