Your cookie recipe becomes wildly popular! Someone asks if
you can make another recipe that has exactly 500 calories
per cookie (so they can use it as a meal replacement). Keep
the rest of your award-winning process the same (100
teaspoons, same ingredients, same scoring system).

For example, given the ingredients above, if you had instead
selected 40 teaspoons of butterscotch and 60 teaspoons of
cinnamon (which still adds to 100), the total calorie count
would be 40\*8 + 60\*3 = 500. The total score would go down,
though: only 57600000, the best you can do in such trying
circumstances.

Given the ingredients in your kitchen and their properties,
what is the total score of the highest-scoring cookie you
can make with a calorie total of 500?
