This problem suggests the use of linear programming, which
is the traditional way to solve this kind of thing. But the
nonlinearity of negative ingredient sums makes that hard,
plus it's a lot of work. So brute force again.

The interesting part of the Haskell is the thing that
computes all the possible ingredient combinations.
