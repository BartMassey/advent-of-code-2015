The next year, to speed up the process, Santa creates a
robot version of himself, Robo-Santa, to deliver presents
with him.

Santa and Robo-Santa start at the same location (delivering
two presents to the same starting house), then take turns
moving based on instructions from the elf, who is
eggnoggedly reading from the same script as the previous
year.

This year, how many houses receive at least one present?

For example:

* `^v` delivers presents to 3 houses, because Santa goes
  north, and then Robo-Santa goes south.
* `^>v<` now delivers presents to 3 houses, and Santa and
  Robo-Santa end up back where they started.
* `^v^v^v^v^v` now delivers presents to 11 houses, with
  Santa going one direction and Robo-Santa going the other.
