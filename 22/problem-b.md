On the next run through the game, you increase the difficulty to hard.

At the start of each player turn (before any other effects apply), you lose 1 hit point. If this brings you to or below 0 hit points, you lose.

With the same starting stats for you and the boss, what is the least amount of mana you can spend and still win the fight?
